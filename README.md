# beta-VAE representations of random-dot stimulus

Studied how a constrained variational autoencoder (https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl) would represent multiple items in space. 
Such framework mimics functional goals of a working memory system in human observers, 
that is, to most faithfully represent sensory information given its limited capacity.
